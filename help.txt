Info
=====

Utilities.cs is for the auto paks finder
researcher.cs is for the researcher (finds and replaces the bytes in pak file)


Packages:
Newtonsoft.json is for the auto paks finder
Fody & Costura.Fody is a NuGet package which imports the .dlls into the exe (like the Newtonsoft.json) so 
only the exe is dependent so it looks clean so it's just the exe which is dependent


===
Offsets:

e.g: public int swap1offset = 70000000;
The 70000000 is where in the pak files it searches it from. The number should be lower than the original dec offset so after Fortnite updates it still works!
The bytes are the Hex codes in decimal, you can use something like this: https://www.convzone.com/hex-to-decimal/ then put the commas in the decimal by replacing each " " (space) with "," (comma)
