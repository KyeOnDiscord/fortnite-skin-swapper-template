Offsets:

e.g: public long swap1offset = 70000000;
The 70000000 is where in the pak files it searches it from. The number should be lower than the original dec offset so after Fortnite updates it still works!
The bytes are the Hex codes in decimal, you can use something like this: https://www.convzone.com/hex-to-decimal/ then put the commas in the decimal by replacing each " " (space) with "," (comma)
